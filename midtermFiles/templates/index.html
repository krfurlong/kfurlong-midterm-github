		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Foreign aid plays an incredibly important role in the economies of developing nations and in ensuring the 
		international security of developed nations worldwide. Largely viewed in the academic and political 
		communities as invaluable to global stability, foreign aid from wealthy nations to less politically and/or 
		economically stable nations helps connect different peoples and lessens the prevalence and severity of global 
		conflict and terrorism. Even current generals in the United States recognize the importance of foreign aid as 
		provided through the U.S. Department of State, going as far to state: </p>

		<p>Given these widely acknowledged social benefits to international foreign aid, the increasingly isolationist 
		rhetoric of the Trump administration comes as a significant threat to global security. While funding national 
		defense efforts is indeed of great importance to the safety of the United States and its citizens, both 
		domestic and abroad, <a href = "http://www.un.org/esa/documents/Development.and.Conflict2.pdf">funding peace 
		efforts in areas of conflict within developing nations actually is more effective as it stems conflict and 
		crisis at its source</a>. However, historically, the extent to which the developed world provided aid to the 
		developing world has been somewhat limited and unfortunately, often reserved for countries or regions at the 
		onset of conflict. </p>

<h2>The Data</h2>
<p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is an international economic organization 
comprised of thirty-five member nations. Founded in 1961, the stated purpose of this critical intergovernmental group 
is to <b>promote policies that will improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.</b> 
by encouraging global trade and international economic outreach activities. As a part of its pursuit of this missin, 
the OECD has collected vast amounts of data on the economic activities of the world and in particular those of the member 
nations. The topics of their database range from health indicators to measures of social/technical innovation to economic 
activities; however, for the purpose of our analysis, we pulled publically available data regarding the quantity of 
foreign aid from OECD member nations to non-OECD nations from the inception of this organization (1960) to the most recent 
year available (2016). </p>

<p>While incredibly comprehensive, the initial structure of our data was not ideal for web visualization with Tableau’s 
resources. For this reason, we imported our data set into R for some minor data cleaning and significant data wrangling 
to transform the data from a “wide” format ideal for time-series cluster analysis to a “long” format ideal for 
visualization. Furthermore, our data lacked any indication of the continent of each donating and receiving country, 
so we joined this information to our data set using SQL statements. Finally, due to the sheer size of our data set and 
the computationally taxing nature of big data web visualization in Tableau, we chose to filter our data using SQL 
statements to only include information where an OECD nation donated at least $500,000 to a non-OECD nation, adjusted 
for inflation. Although this intentional omission results in slightly less detailed visualizations, the overall narrative 
remains the same and <a href = "https://stats.oecd.org/qwids/">the omitted data can be easily downloaded for those 
interested in this granular data.</a></p>

<h2>Mapping Foreign Aid, 1960-2016</h2>
<p>With our data well-defined and <a href="about">other potential data limitations considered</a>,  
we can begin our analysis. The following dashboard shows the worldwide relationship between the 
donor nation and recipient of foreign aid from 1960 to 2016. To see a more detailed analysis, we can drill down 
the information presented to evaluate the flow of aid on both the continent and the country level. As you can see 
clearly in the continents legend in the top-right corner of the dashboard, historically most of the aid goes to 
Africa (blue square) and Asia (orange square), and the primary donor is Europe (red square) as seen in the data 
summary on the right-side of the dashboard.</p>

<p>
In using the visualization to view foreign aid by country as a function of time, we noted that donations from 
European nations spike after 2000 as a result of the 
<a href = "https://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/historical-overview-eu-cooperation-and-aid_en">EU fight against 
poverty as part of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)</a> and the impending <em>War Against Terrorism</em> 
immediately following 9/11. We invite you explore the data in more detail by clicking on any of the countries 
in the map to zoom in and filter the aid distributed by donor for that region. Let’s learn about international 
foreign aid!

<h2>Understanding Trends in Foreign Aid, 1960-2016</h2>
<p>
While our earlier dashboard is incredibly helpful in understanding aggregate trends of foreign aid, it is also 
important to understand foreign aid in terms of the specific flow of funds between developed and developing nations. 
To do so, we designed the following graph, a Sankey diagram, which shows the flow of monetary and economic resources 
from OECD countries (located on the left-side in bright colors) to recipient countries (located on the right-side in 
greyscale). </p>

<p>The default view of this visualization is set to 2016 and intentionally omits the United States to better display 
the contributions of all other nations. However, we invite you to adjust the temporal aspect of this diagram using the
 slider on the bottom of the view to the year 1960 and reintroduce the United States to the diagram using the filter 
 option in the bottom-left corner of the visualization. We can see that in 1960 United States provided 69.3% of the total
 aid sources, and the primary recipients were India (36.2%) and Pakistan (12.5%). This surge was likely due to the fact that
 <a href = "https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/usaid-history">both nations were facing political disputes and economic 
 issues during that time</a>. Generally, it is important to note that we express these donations in terms of proportions as this scales the data and fails to acknowledge the fact that the 
 total amount of foreign aid has dramatically increased from 1960 to 2016. </p>
 
<p>Using a Sankey diagram also introduces a different perspective to this data set as it highlights how 
different the donors and recipients are on a geopolitical spectrum. More over, the Sankey diagram emphasizes how 
foreign aid is largely a reactionary measure in the international community as clearly seen in the increase of aid 
economic resources send to Afghanistan, and more broadly the Middle-East, following the terrorist attacks of 2001. 
As seen in shifting the temporal slider bar, we clearly see a trend of developed countries providing foreign aid as a 
way to deploy their soft power to avoid political destabilization, yet only in response to catastrophic events in these 
developing nations. </p>

<p>
Using the time filter, we can see two other significant changes compared with 1960. First, the United States now 
provides 33.1% of total aid, which is a considerable reduction in their participation, and countries such as United 
Kingdom (12%), Japan (13.8%), and Germany (11.9%) appeared as relevant contributors in 2016. Also, we can see that 
while there are many more recipient countries in 2016 relative to 1960, none of them receives more than Afghanistan, 
which was given 7% of the total aid. As with our previous visualization, we encourage you to explore the Sankey diagram 
in more detail by filtering by year and by different donor nations.

<h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>

<p>Foreign aid plays an integral role in the economies of developing nations, yet as our analysis shows, this role has 
fundamentally changed over time. While historically the United States and United Kingdom played outsized roles in terms 
of the dollar amount of their foreign aid, the landscape for donating nations in 2016 is distinctly different with the 
European Union collectively contributing more resources to this endeavor than the United States. Our visualizations 
highlight the fact that although in some cases foreign aid remain constant between nations regardless of the geopolitical 
climate of that time, foreign aid predominately goes to nations retroactively as a response to some political crisis, 
economic calamity, or severe humanitarian crisis. Key examples of these shifts in foreign aid resources displayed in 
our visualizations include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The gradual decline and eventual fall of the Soviet Union in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s </li>
	<li>The steady stream of fiscal resources towards Vietnam in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s as a result of the U.S.-led coalition during the Vietnam War</li>
	<li>The impact of the 9/11 attacks and reactionary surge of resources towards the Middle-East and high-risk African nations </li>
</ul>
<p>
Somewhat masked in our visualizations, however, are the equally important success stories. For instance, India 
received a large bulk of foreign aid in the early 1960’s as it transitioned from colonial rule to a sovereign nation, 
which likely helped fuel its rapid ascent to a global economic power. It is somewhat ironic that our visualization 
fail to easily identify these clear benefits to foreign aid as they are incidentally the aspects so often overlooked 
by politicians and decision-makers aiming to save a few funds by redirecting these resources to fuel local efforts. 
International aid plays a critical role in reshaping global economic inequality and righting wrongs committed over 
centuries of colonial rule and discriminatory subjugation. Perhaps only after drawing attention to the critical nature 
of these issues by identifying those nations which benefited immensely from these foreign sources of assistance will 
international leaders both domestically and abroad truly recognize why continued financial commitment in these activities 
is essential for the security of our world.
